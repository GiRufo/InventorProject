    	    <p>Since she was a shaker she never patented any of these creations and two French 
    	    men were able to patent the circular saw in 1816 when they saw it in Shaker 
    	    papers. </p>
    	    <p>In 1810, at the age of
    	    31 she thought of an easier way for the men to saw logs that wouldn't use so 
    	    much of their energy. She reviewed the pit saw, a common tool that the men 
    	    would use to cut wood. This saw used two handles which two men would pull from 
    	    side to side to use. This was problematic because the saw could only cut 
    	    through the wood when it was being pulled forward, so the following pull would
    	    be nearly useless until it was pulled back into its starting position. Tabitha 
    	    realized that using a rounded blade would be more efficient and use up less 
    	    energy. To do this she attached a circular blade to her spinning wheel and used
    	    the pedal to power the blade. The blade would spin, allowing the wood to be cut
    	    faster with less manpower. </p>

    	    <p>Similarly, her next invention was meant to improve
    	    life. Working as a weaver she improved the process of the average spinning 
    	    wheel by creating a double spinning head so women could spin twice as much 
    	    as normal. She worked with fellow inventor Eli Whitney on the invention of
    	    cut nails. </p></aside>

    	    <p><b>Sarah Babbitt</b>, though she is primarily known by her middle name, 
    	    <b>Tabitha</b>, an American inventor born to Seth 
    	    and Elizabeth Babbitt on the 9th of December, 1779 in Hardwick, Massachusetts. Not much is known about 
    	    her early life until the start of her membership with the Harvard Shaker 
    	    community in Massachusetts on August 12th, 1793 at the age of 14. Tabitha lived
    	    her life as a quiet and shy weaver in the community, and her watchfulness led 
    	    her to observe men hard at work in the forest industry, moving her to begin
    	    inventing things to make their work easier and more efficient. 
    	     It is claimed that she was in the process of inventing an improved 
    	    spinning wheel head and false teeth made of wax when she died in Harvard, 
    	    Massachusetts on December 10th, 1853, a day after her 74th birthday.</p> 
    	
    	    <aside id="sidebarB"><h1>Facts About the Shaker Community</h1>
    	    <ul>
    	    <p><li>They are a religious sect that began in England in the mid-1700s by Mother Ann Lee and eight followers who had immigrated to New York in 1774 to escape persecution.</li>
    	    <li>At its height in the mid-1800s, the Shaker community had over 5 thousand "brothers and sisters" who lived in about 18 "societies"</li>
    	    <li>Because the Shakers believe in celibacy, there are only 12 Shakers left who continue to try and recruit new members to this day</li>
    	    <li>Shakerism was the first religion to use electricity, telephones, own cars, trucks, and tractors, televisions, computers, and other modern conveniences.</li></p></aside>
